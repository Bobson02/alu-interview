Minimum Operations


Overview

minimum_operations is a project that calculates the minimum number of operations required to reach a target number from 1, using the allowed operations. The operations can include adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing by specific integers. The goal is to achieve the target number with the fewest operations.

This project can be used to practice algorithmic thinking and improve the efficiency of problem-solving using a dynamic approach.

Features

Efficient Calculation: Finds the minimum number of operations required.
Dynamic Programming Approach: Uses dynamic programming to minimize computation time and maximize performance.
Customizable Operations: Allows you to modify the set of operations or constraints.
Installation

To use minimum_operations on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/minimum_operations.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd minimum_operations
Install the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Usage
To use the minimum_operations script, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
node minimum_operations.js <target_number>
Where <target_number> is the number you want to reach starting from 1.

Example
bash
Copy code
node minimum_operations.js 15
Output:

css
Copy code
Minimum operations to reach 15: 4
This means it takes 4 operations to reach 15 from 1 using the allowed operations.

Algorithms and Complexity
The algorithm used in minimum_operations is designed to minimize the computational complexity. The main approach involves:

Dynamic Programming: The program stores intermediate results to avoid redundant calculations.
Breadth-First Search (BFS): BFS is used to explore the shortest path to the target.
The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the target number.
